I am going to attempt to make a browser game using craftyjs that will be a simple bot vs bot game, but the game will be controlled by a program written by the players of the game.



---- some helpful git notes (I'm new to git)
add -> git add * (or filename)
then
commit -> git commit -m "msg"
then
push to server -> git push origin master
